From the very beginning of his journey, he has shown a strong passion for the technical field, especially in areas like Web Development and AI/ML. What sets Saptarshi apart is not just his technical skills, but also his genius-level creativity and ability to come up with innovative ideas.

His consistency, self-learning ability, and hunger for knowledge are truly admirable. I am confident that whether now or in the future, if given any opportunity, Saptarshi will excel and deliver outstanding results. He is definitely someone to watch out for!",
